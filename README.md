# Pokemon Project

# Description

I am a computer science student who is teaching herself to code. This is a small project that prints some of the data from the Pokemon Go files provided by the [pokemongo-json-pokedex](https://github.com/pokemongo-dev-contrib/pokemongo-json-pokedex). I am doing this project because:

* I want to learn how to use PHP to work with JSON files. I really had no idea how to get PHP to print out multi-dimensional arrays especially ones that don't contain the same amount of items. Some Pokemon have 6 different charged attacks and some have just two. I was looking for array.length but, have yet to find it in PHP. I used for loops to get past these parts. I'll keep looking.
* I want to work more with Bootstrap .card-columns. They give me a headache. I can't get them to respond right for medium and iPad sizes. I have read this is a problem with the Chrome browser and I use Chrome so it might be that.

# Future Dreams 12/10/2018

I'd like to someday be able to sort the list of Pokemon by baseAttack, Pokedex number or name. I would like to have buttons that allow the Pokemon to display in different orders. I have to figure out if this is possible with PHP. This whole thing is probably easier with JavaScript. I might try and do it again in JavaScript. I am really able to understand underlying principles better with PHP at this point though. Sometimes I will find myself dreaming about how certain code problems might translate from PHP to JavaScript. My mind is trying to sort out the learning process. I feel like I am learning at a snail's pace. I feel like I have to hack at something with an ax for hours to get one thing to work. Maybe that's where the word hacking comes from. Maybe I am not alone in this feeling. If someone reads this and has any simple advice about sorting arrays that come from JSON files, I'd love to hear it. My brain has smoke coming out of it.
